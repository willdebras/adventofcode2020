If you are finding this, this is my personal repo for the 2020 Advent of
Code challenge. I am using this to practice algorithmic thinking, branch
out and write more code in Julia, and to just have fun. Feel free to
ping me if you have questions\!

### Star badges

I am also using this repo as an opportunity to test out adding custom
repo badges that scrape a userâ€™s star count and create a badge out of
it. You can see an example at the top of this page.
